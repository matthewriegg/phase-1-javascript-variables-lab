// //- `companyName` &mdash; Inside the `test/indexTest.js` file, look at the
// `describe` function call for the `companyName` variable. The two `it` function
// calls inside this `describe` tell us the features of `companyName` we need to
// create. To review, in the first `it` function call, it says that `it`
// (companyName) `is set as Scuber`. In the next line, you can see that the test
// checks to make sure this occurs by seeing if `companyName` equals `Scuber`. So
// this means that you need to go to your `index.js` file and declare a variable
// named `companyName` and set it equal to `Scuber`.
// - In the second `it` function call for `companyName`, it says it `is defined as
// a const`. The next line of code tests this. So you need to make sure that you
// are using the correct type of variable declaration such that attempting to
// reassign the variable throws an error.

const companyName = 'Scuber';

let mostProfitableNeighborhood = 'Chelsea';

let companyCeo = 'Susan Smith';
